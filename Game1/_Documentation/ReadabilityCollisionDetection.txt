NUMBER OF MINUTES TAKEN TO COMPLETE REVIEW - 21 minutes


SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON WHAT IS READABLE AND WHAT ISN'T (AT LEAST 5) - Collision helper/container object was very well written and readable. Only change I would have made is declaring whose side the 'side' variable was.
																	For colliison detection, the lists at the top should be a bit more spaced out. That declaration looks stuffed and tight.
																	I feel some of code in the for eachs in each collision check could also be spaced a little more.
																	The for eachs might also be better off being seperated into methods that return their own lists, to prevent clutter of so much logic on screen at once
																	Determine side is readable, and also has good debugging.
																	Once again, it is hard to determine from a first glance who the side variable belongs to.
																	lots of spelling errors.
