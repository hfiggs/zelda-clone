Comments:
	- The use of command classes helps give the CollisionHandler more cohesion by not including individual collision case handling.
	- The class is fairly short and easy to read which makes it very easy to add new tuples later on if necessary.
	- I believe this class is very maintainable, as it is easy and straight forward to make additions to.
Hypethetical change:
	- I don't feel there are any changes that need to be made to the class. If changes were made I feel like it would involve changing from the All Collision Handler design as a whole which wouldn't be worth the effort.
