Comments:
	- The class has high cohesion as it mainly relies on: Bat.cs, EnemyStateMachine.cs, and IEnemyState.cs
	- The class is also resuable, in that you could easily create another enemy with random movement using the code
Hypethetical change:
	- You could make the bat stay in place randomly for a period of time to make the bat more like the bats in game
	- This would be easy to add in. All you would need to do is add in another case to the switch statement in GetRandomDirection
	  to where the bats direction doesn't change at all.
