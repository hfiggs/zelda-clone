NAME OF FILE BEING REVIEWED - GameStateRoomToRoomEast.cs


AUTHOR OF FILE BEING REVIEWED - Hunter Figgs


SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT CODE QUALITY (AT LEAST 5) -  

-GameStateRoomToRoomEast implements the IGameState interface reducing the amount of coupling. This makes it a 
 lot easier to call methods like Update and Draw on on this game state. 

-GameStateRoomToRoomEast.cs has good cohesion. This state soley focuses on the transition for going through an
 East door meaning it is only responsible for updating the screen when playing the east room transitions. 
 It is not responsible for other game states like losing, winning, or pausing or any other transition directions.

-GameStateRoom depends on IController and HUD and Screen. This is very good coupling meaking the code very easy
 to maintain.

-Really good use of SpriteBatch methods to play the transitions. This probably helped us avoid adding new sprites
 for the room transitions and is much more maintainable than other options.

-The Mouse.SetPosition(150, 150) call on line 74 includes magic numbers. Removing these will make the code 
 easier to understand and more maintainable in the future. 


A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE THAT COULD BE MADE TO THE FILE, AND HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO IMPLEMENT THAT CHANGE - 

-Make the room transition a serperate state instead of having it in GameStateRoom. This would make GameStateRoom
 have even higher cohesion.
