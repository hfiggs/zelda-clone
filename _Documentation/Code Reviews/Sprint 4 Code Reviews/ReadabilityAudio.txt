NUMBER OF MINUTES TAKEN TO COMPLETE REVIEW - 30


SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON WHAT IS READABLE AND WHAT ISN'T (AT LEAST 5) - 

-Class is fairly long at over 350 lines. However, most of the methods are fairy short 5-15 lines long.

-The method PlayItemSound compares string literals in the switch statement when it may be possible to compare 
 and use types instead.

-Few magic numbers and the magic numbers that do exist are stored in private/readonly variables.

-The addition of an "app.config" file that stores a users audio settings is a pretty need and helpful idea. Makes
 it much easier for the user to control and view their settings. This makes the readability for the user stronger
 in my opinion.

-Variable and Method names are very self-explanatory.
