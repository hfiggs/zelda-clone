SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON WHAT IS READABLE AND WHAT ISN'T (AT LEAST 5) - As far as the specific drops for each kind of enemy, switch statements may not be the best way to handle routing the random
																	number to a specific drop, especially since there are different probabilities for each drop. Additionally, there are differing
																	"randomMax" values that should probably be a constant variable within the scope of the class rather than just 1 function. If the
																	switch statements were removed, then there would be no need for a "max" value, as a certain random function returns a random
																	number from 1-0, and then decimal probabilities could be tested for in a set of if/else blocks. Obviously, these probabilities
																	would need to be predefined as constants, which might clutter the fields of the class, but would help the readability of the
																	"GetDrops" function. Also within the GetDrops function, it may be better to have a dictionary of all the enemies and a list of
																	necessary probabilities. That way you could generalize the function to one set of if/else blocks that would differ only in
																	probabilities pulled out from the dictionary of probabilities. Finally, the hasDrops list works well to help the readability as
																	it avoids branching of any kind when checking to see if an enemy even has drops. However, this list never changes during runtime,
																	and should likely be initialized as a constant outside of the constructor.
