SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON WHAT IS READABLE AND WHAT ISN'T (AT LEAST 5) - Clean interface, follows the layout of the rest of our interfaces.
																	Mouse lock position is magic numbers. Make a point called mouse position lock.
																	Could use some comments around the resolution matrix code. Others might not know what the methods do.
																	Try to figure out what the variable is instead of using var.
																	Short code that doesn't take too long to understand in almost all the files. mostly removed magic numbers. Good work.
