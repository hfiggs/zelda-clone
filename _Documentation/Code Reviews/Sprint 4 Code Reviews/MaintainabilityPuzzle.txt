SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT CODE QUALITY (AT LEAST 5) - Good use of interfaces
													Good seperation of tasks, each puzzle is in its own class.
													Could use better named variables, and could clean up include statements
													Good use of an if statement to prevent unnecessary runs through logic.
													overall short code, smells of easy maintainability.


A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE THAT COULD BE MADE TO THE FILE, AND HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO IMPLEMENT THAT CHANGE - IF we wanted to add a room with multiple puzzles or implement our own puzzles it should be quite simple. We could loop through

		all possible puzzles for the room, or for making a new puzzle you just need to implement the interface and apply the puzzle to an XML room.
