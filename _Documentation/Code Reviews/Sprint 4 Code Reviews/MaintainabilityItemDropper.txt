AUTHOR OF FILE BEING REVIEWED - Sergei Fedulov


NUMBER OF MINUTES TAKEN TO COMPLETE REVIEW - 13


SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT CODE QUALITY (AT LEAST 5) -
	- The file is split into methods with clear functionality
	- It is obvious where you would need to edit the code to add in or change drops for existing enemies
	- The file makes adding in new enemies and their respective drops simple
	- Overall the ItemDropper file is clear on what it does which helps make it easier to add code in the future

A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE THAT COULD BE MADE TO THE FILE, AND HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO IMPLEMENT THAT CHANGE - 
	- I don't think this change is needed, but you could use if else statements instead of switch cases for 
	determining what item drops. This might make it easier to create probablities for each item drop. This would not
	take much time to implement.
