SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON WHAT IS READABLE AND WHAT ISN'T (AT LEAST 5) - 
	- The file is short (60 lines of code)
	- The check method is simple and straightforward
	- The file has variable names that do a good job at informing the reader what they do
	- Because the file is so short it isn't an issue, but variable e could be named environment to help clarify what it represents
	- Overall the file has good readablity and isn't necessarily in need of any changes
