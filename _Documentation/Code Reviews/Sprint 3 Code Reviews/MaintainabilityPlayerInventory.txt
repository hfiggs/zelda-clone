AUTHOR OF FILE BEING REVIEWED -  Hunter Figgs


SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT CODE QUALITY (AT LEAST 5) - Lots of methods, but seems are all needed.
													All methods simple, easy to maintain and change if something needs to be changed.
													Works much better for learning about player's inventory than keeping it in ENUMs.
													Not sure if we need an interface for playerinventory, shouldn't it always be the same across players?
													I feel the hlaf hearts in ints could be similarly implemented as floats.


A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE THAT COULD BE MADE TO THE FILE, AND HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO IMPLEMENT THAT CHANGE - Changing maps and compasses to be dungeon specfic. Should be a really simple fix, just change the interface and then change

the variables to match.
