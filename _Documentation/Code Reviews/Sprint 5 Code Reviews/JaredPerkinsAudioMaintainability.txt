NAME OF FILE BEING REVIEWED - AudioManager	


AUTHOR OF FILE BEING REVIEWED -  Jeff Gaydos


SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT CODE QUALITY (AT LEAST 5) - First notice is the class is almost 350 lines long.
													Lost of broken apart methods, would most likely work with added features easily.
													Stop music method has a comment about something deliberately left unchecked with no explanation
													Same as above for stop sound
													Simple methods, basic boolean logic, not a lot of nested statements.
													



A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE THAT COULD BE MADE TO THE FILE, AND HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO IMPLEMENT THAT CHANGE - Definitely break some things off into Util classes. Maybe a soundEffects manager and a music manager. Lots of code in one class, could be brought down.
