NUMBER OF MINUTES TAKEN TO COMPLETE REVIEW - 15


SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT CODE QUALITY (AT LEAST 5) - 
	- The utility class has good readability, the variables are well named and the file is less than 100 lines.
	- The class is clear on which methods handle what due to clear naming.
	- It would be easy to add in more interactions with the portals in the future by either adding in another method or adding cases into the existing switch statements.
	- The file has pretty low coupling, it only knows about Environment, Player, Projectile and Roomloading.
	- Overall the file seems very maintainable and easy to add on to or edit in the future.

A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE THAT COULD BE MADE TO THE FILE, AND HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO IMPLEMENT THAT CHANGE - 
	- This isn't necessary but you could add special interactions between enemies and the portals for different puzzle types 
	(Navigating through tricky rooms). This wouldn't be hard to add you would just need to add in a method that handles portalblock, enemy interactions.
