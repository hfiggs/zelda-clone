SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON WHAT IS READABLE AND WHAT ISN'T (AT LEAST 5) - 

-The class overall is just under 86 lines and each method is a reasonable length makig the code easy to read.

-The method and variale names are self explanatory making it easy to understand what each method does.

-No magic numbers anywhere in the code. Any arbitrary values are difend using constant fields.

-Defining the otherPortal, editVector and other variables implicitly using var can be a bit confusing and may
hurt the readability of the code since the type of the varaible is not explicitly stated.

-The way otherPortal is first defined in HandlePlayerProtal is very long and can be a bit confusing if the reader
is not familiar with lambda functions and conditional operators.
