NAME OF FILE BEING REVIEWED -  Multiplayer files (Player2, all changes made across multiple files to support new player)


AUTHOR OF FILE BEING REVIEWED - Jeff Gaydos and Patrick Haughn


NUMBER OF MINUTES TAKEN TO COMPLETE REVIEW - 45 minutes (lots of code to look over in different places)


SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON WHAT IS READABLE AND WHAT ISN'T (AT LEAST 5) - Player 2 reads just as well as player 1. Decent length, nothing unneeded.
																	One issue in player class, long line boolean check in use item. Maybe pull that into a method so its more readable.
																	New player to player collision command reads easy. 
																	New HUD work made a lot of long calculations and logic that is a little difficult to read. 
																	New HUD work put the class at almost 200 lines. 
																	Maybe split the hud types into two different classes.
																	Collision detection for player 2 checks is just added another layer of loops to detection.
																	Not sure if it falls into readability, but new Player 2 sprites look really good.
