SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON WHAT IS READABLE AND WHAT ISN'T (AT LEAST 5) - 
	- The file has good variable names which makes it easy to read and figure out what's going on.
	- There are a decent amount of loops and ifs which make it a bit confusing at first glance, but they are necessary and pretty straight forward/simple.
	- DecideDirection could use variable named constants to help clarify what is being checked for in the if statements.
	- Overall the file has pretty good readability. Getting a general idea of what's going on and which sections do what isn't that difficult.
