SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON WHAT IS READABLE AND WHAT ISN'T (AT LEAST 5) - For the switch statement involving difficulty, one would expect there to be a case for "Easy", "Meadium", and "Hard", but
																	there is only a case for "Hard" and "Medium" and then it defaults to "Medium". If this is intended behavior, a comment would
																	be beneficial to explain why "Medium" is default and not "Easy". All string constants have the form"[Name]Tag", except for
																	"NonInteractEnvironment" Consider renaming the variable to tell the reader that it is used in the same way as the other string
																	constants. All functions act as wrappers around the necessary XML getters, so this increases readability not only in this file
																	but all the files that use there functions. Code is short and in general very straightforward.
