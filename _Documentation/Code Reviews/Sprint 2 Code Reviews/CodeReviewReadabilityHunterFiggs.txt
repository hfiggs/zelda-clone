Sprint #: 2

Name of .cs file: '...\Game1\Environment\EnvironmentSpriteFactory.cs'

Author of .cs file: Jeff Gaydos

Number of minutes: 8 mins

Comments:

	- Length is nearly 200 lines, but I think that is reasonable for a factory file. It is pretty homogeneous.

	- The above could be mitigated by using region tags (#) to separate groups of things like doors, "decorations", misc. etc.

	- Naming convention for the methods is to start with upper case letters. Not a huge deal for readability, but it might help.

	- It's not obvious where the spriteID going into the constructors is coming from.

	- LoadContent method short and sweet. Though not exactly sure what "ss" refers to in the file names.
