Sprint: 2
File: Player1.cs
Code Authors: Hunter Figgs, Jared Perkins
Comments:
• There are 2 item getters, "getItem" and "GetItem", could cause an issue when attempting to maintain
• The GetLocation() function has magic numbers that could scale with the size of the sprite

Hypotehtical Change: Link can sprint (i.e. hold a button and move to sprint)
Effects:
• Add states for sprinting in all directions (4 new files)
• Add to the state machine interface to allow all states to transition to all sprinting states (4 new functions in 1 file)
• Implement sprinting state transitions on all states (4 new functions in 16 files)
• Add sprint functions to Player1 and IPlayer (4 new functions in 2 files)
• Note that no extra sprites would be necessary, just copy the existing move states and change the animationTime variable
• A new key would need to be added to the keyboard controller and this key would be checked before executing movement commands
